I am an associate professor in the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn) (former ICST) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am affiliated with the group of Web Information Processing. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap) and obtained my PhD from [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Prior to Edinburgh, I worked with Prof. Jufu Feng on pattern recognition at Peking University.

My current research focuses on harnessing large language models for social good, to support intelligent applications for people who are in need. We are fortunate to be supported by NSFC, RGC, the MOST and also partners from industry.
